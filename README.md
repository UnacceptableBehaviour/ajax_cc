01_temp_converter - [MS hello world](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/how-to/)  

Works offline on mob and can save shortcut to Homescreen which works offline.
But doesn't install because not https!

  
```
cd 01_temp_converter
npx http-server             # run server - opens port 8081 (other using 8080 default)

http://192.168.1.13:8081    # navigate here on phone 
```
